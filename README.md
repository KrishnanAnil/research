App created with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 3.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation and running

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Clone / download this repo 


If Composer is installed globally, to install dependencies, run

```bash
composer install
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.


## Configuration and Database

Download and install mysql database. Can be done using XAMPP here : https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Open and run the scripts.sql file from the repo to create the database.

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasources'` and any other
configuration relevant for your application.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses a subset of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
